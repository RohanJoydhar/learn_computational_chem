    "# Portfolio Optimization Problem\n",
    "- In our case, we are solving a risk minimization problem using a conic programming approach, where you define the objective function as a risk measure and enforce constraints based on asset weights and portfolio performance.\n",
    "- Conic optimization allows the efficient solution of problems where the objective or constraints can be expressed in terms of convex cones. The power cone constraints used are a natural way to handle the non-linearity introduced by the Kaniadakis logarithm and other variables.\n",
    "- Kaniadakis logarithmic function introduces a degree of non-linearity that helps capture non-standard risk measures. The use of ln_k allow us to model risk in a more flexible way than traditional measures like variance or Value at Risk"

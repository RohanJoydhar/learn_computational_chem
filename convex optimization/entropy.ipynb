    "# Entropy Maximization\n",
    "- Entropy maximization is the central optimization technique. This approach maximizes the entropy of a probability distribution subject to constraints. It is commonly used in information theory, statistical mechanics, and various machine learning applications.\n",
    "- In this problem, the objective function is cp.entr(x), which represents the element-wise entropy of the vector x. Entropy measures the uncertainty or randomness in a system, and maximizing it leads to a distribution that is as \"spread out\" or \"uncertain\" as possible\n",
    "- Entropy function for valriable x is: entr(x) = -xlog(x)\n",
    "- The function entr(x) is concave for x>0, making this a convex optimization problem because maximizing a concave function is a standard approach in convex optimization.\n",
    "- cost function  in this problem is the sum of the entropies of the element of vector x"
